# SocialSync: Multi-Post Master

Welcome to SocialSync! This project simplifies the process of posting content to multiple social media platforms simultaneously using a single Python script.

## Directory Structure

```
project_directory/
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ post_content.sh
â””â”€â”€ script.py
```

## Usage

### 1. Set Up Environment

- Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
- Install required Python packages using pip:
  ```
  pip install tweepy facebook-sdk  # Install packages for Twitter and Facebook APIs
  ```

### 2. Set Up Social Media API Tokens

- Obtain API tokens for each social media platform you want to post to (e.g., Twitter, Facebook, Instagram).

### 3. Configure Script

- Open `script.py` in a text editor.
- Replace placeholder functions (`post_to_twitter`, `post_to_facebook`, `post_to_instagram`) with functions that interact with the respective social media APIs.
- Ensure API tokens are securely stored and used for authentication.

### 4. Run the Script

- Navigate to the project directory.
- Ensure `post_content.sh` has executable permissions:
  ```
  chmod +x post_content.sh
  ```
- Run the Bash script `post_content.sh`:
  ```
  ./post_content.sh
  ```
- Follow prompts to enter the image path and text content you want to post.

### 5. Enjoy Your Posts!

- Sit back and relax as your content gets posted to all your favorite social media platforms at once!
- Check the command line for verbose information on the success or failure of each API call.

## Notes

- Ensure your image path is correct and the image file exists.
- Respect API usage limits and guidelines for each social media platform.
- Handle any errors or exceptions gracefully to ensure smooth operation of the script.
