🎉 Welcome to the SocialSync: Multi-Post Master Project! 🎉

This project aims to simplify the process of posting content to multiple social media platforms using a single Python script. With just a few simple steps, you can post your content to Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram simultaneously!

📝 How to Use:

1. **Set Up Environment:**
   - Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
   - Install any necessary Python packages using pip:
     ```
     pip install tweepy facebook-sdk  # Install packages for Twitter and Facebook APIs
     ```

2. **Set Up Social Media API Tokens:**
   - Obtain API tokens for each social media platform you want to post to (e.g., Twitter, Facebook, Instagram).

3. **Configure Script:**
   - Open `script.py` in a text editor.
   - Replace the placeholder functions (`post_to_twitter`, `post_to_facebook`, `post_to_instagram`) with functions that interact with the respective social media APIs.
   - Ensure that your API tokens are securely stored and used for authentication.

4. **Run the Script:**
   - Navigate to the project directory.
   - Make sure `post_content.sh` has executable permissions:
     ```
     chmod +x post_content.sh
     ```
   - Run the Bash script `post_content.sh`:
     ```
     ./post_content.sh
     ```
   - Follow the prompts to enter the image path and text content you want to post.

5. **Enjoy Your Posts!**
   - Sit back and relax as your content gets posted to all your favorite social media platforms at once!
   - Check the command line for verbose information on the success or failure of each API call.

📌 Note:
- Make sure your image path is correct and the image file exists.
- Respect the API usage limits and guidelines for each social media platform.
- Handle any errors or exceptions gracefully to ensure smooth operation of the script.

🚀 Happy Posting with SocialSync! 🚀
